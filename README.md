# Starship Recommendation Test

## Task
Write a basic recommendation system for starships using the Star Wars API.

How you recommend starships is up to you.

When submitting a post request to ${host}/starships/:id a list of alternatives should be returned.

You can learn more about the Starwars API here: https://swapi.co

The python helper for Swapi has also been added to this repository - but this starter pack does **not** need to be used to complete this test. Use any frameworks you like.

## Submitting the test
Create a new git repo and send the link to the hiring manager along with part one of this test.
